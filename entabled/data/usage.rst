Usage
-----
* Use the controls to filter the DESeq results based on min/max values.  It's
  OK if one of the fields is blank.
* For example, to see only upregulated genes, you could set max padj to 0.05
  and min log2foldchange to 0.
* The search box will find text in any row and column of the table. This is
  useful for finding genes of interest.

*Note that depending on the size of the data set, it may take several seconds
to load this page.*
